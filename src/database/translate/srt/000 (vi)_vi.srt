( Audio) My Den

2
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:08,588
In the early 20th century,

3
00:00:08,588 --> 00:00:12,967
A meteorologist named Alfred Wegener noticed striking similarities.

4
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:15,970
Between the coasts of Africa and South America.

5
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:20,099
These observations led him to propose a controversial new theory:

6
00:00:20,183 --> 00:00:24,228
Maybe these continents and many others were once connected.

7
00:00:24,228 --> 00:00:26,606
On a single, vast continent.

8
00:00:26,814 --> 00:00:31,986
Wegener's theory of "continental drift" goes against popular opinion

9
00:00:31,986 --> 00:00:35,198
That the continents on Earth have remained stable for millennia.

10
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:38,117
And for his supporters, it took him almost 50 years.

11
00:00:38,117 --> 00:00:40,578
To convince the scientific community on a larger scale.

12
00:00:40,828 --> 00:00:43,414
But today, we know something even more interesting.

13
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,628
In the oldest runoff of supercontinents, "Pangea" is only thought to be the most recent.

14
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:50,463
And it's not going to be the last supercontinent.

15
00:00:50,713 --> 00:00:56,010
"Continuous continental drift" laid the foundation for the modern theory of plate tectonics,

16
00:00:56,052 --> 00:01:00,306
This tells us that the Earth's crust is made up of huge, jagged plates.

17
00:01:00,306 --> 00:01:04,894
That moves over a partially molten rock layer is called mantle.

18
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:11,275
These layers move at a rate of only about 2.5 to 10 centimeters per year.

19
00:01:11,526 --> 00:01:15,113
But these ascending displacements shape the surface of the planet.

20
00:01:15,363 --> 00:01:18,407
So to determine when a supercontinent will emerge,

21
00:01:18,407 --> 00:01:21,244
So we need to predict where these patches are going to drift.

22
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:25,289
One method is to observe how they moved in the past.

23
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:28,709
Geologists can trace the location of continents over time.

24
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:31,629
We're measuring the changes in the magnetic field of the Earth.

25
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,092
As the lava cools, the magnetic minerals freeze.

26
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:38,052
at a particular time.

27
00:01:38,136 --> 00:01:40,972
So by calculating the direction and the intensity

28
00:01:40,972 --> 00:01:43,224
The magnetic field of a given rock.

29
00:01:43,224 --> 00:01:47,687
We can discover latitude at the moment it cools.

30
00:01:47,812 --> 00:01:50,606
But this method has serious limitations.

31
00:01:50,606 --> 00:01:55,153
Because one thing is that a rock's magnetic field doesn't tell us about the longitude of the plate.

32
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:58,573
And the latitude measurement can be either north or south.

33
00:01:59,073 --> 00:02:03,828
Worse still, the magnetic data was erased when the rock heated up again.

34
00:02:03,828 --> 00:02:07,331
Like in continental collisions or volcanic activity.

35
00:02:07,582 --> 00:02:13,546
Geologists therefore need to use other methods to reconstruct continental positions.

36
00:02:13,838 --> 00:02:17,842
The dating of fossils and comparison with the global fossil record

37
00:02:17,842 --> 00:02:21,137
It can help identify areas that were previously connected.

38
00:02:21,262 --> 00:02:25,892
The same is true for other cracks and deformations of the Earth's crust.

39
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:29,061
This can sometimes be traced through continental plates.

40
00:02:29,687 --> 00:02:32,899
Using these methods, scientists have been able to string together

41
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:36,235
Relatively accurate history of plate movement,

42
00:02:36,402 --> 00:02:40,781
And their research has revealed a pattern that spans hundreds of millions of years.

43
00:02:41,032 --> 00:02:43,534
What is now known as the "Wilson Cycle."

44
00:02:43,534 --> 00:02:46,579
It's a prediction of how the continents have split and merged.

45
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:50,124
And recently it predicted that the next supercontinent would form.

46
00:02:50,124 --> 00:02:53,544
It's about 50 to 250 million years from today.

47
00:02:53,836 --> 00:02:57,381
We can't know for sure what that continent will look like.

48
00:02:57,381 --> 00:03:00,968
It could be a new Pangea rising from the closing of the Atlantic Ocean.

49
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,598
Or perhaps it's the formation of a new Pan-Asian Ocean.

50
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,768
But while its shape and size remain a mystery,

51
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:13,439
We know that these changes will affect more than national boundaries.

52
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:18,861
In the past, plate collisions have caused major environmental changes.

53
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:24,283
When the supercontinent Rodinia broke up about 750 million years ago,

54
00:03:24,283 --> 00:03:27,745
It left a vast continent vulnerable to weathering.

55
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:32,959
The recently discovered rock has absorbed more CO2 from the rain,

56
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:36,504
This removes a lot of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

57
00:03:36,504 --> 00:03:41,092
The Earth was in what is known as the " Snowball Earth. "

58
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:46,681
Over time, volcanic activity released CO2, which melted this ice.

59
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:50,601
But that process took another three to six million years.

60
00:03:50,768 --> 00:03:53,688
Meanwhile, as the next supercontinent regrouped,

61
00:03:53,688 --> 00:03:55,648
It's more likely to heat things up.

62
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:00,444
Plate displacements and continental collisions can create and extend

63
00:04:00,444 --> 00:04:02,363
The cracks in the Earth's crust.

64
00:04:02,363 --> 00:04:07,076
This leads to the latent release of large amounts of carbon and CH4 into the atmosphere.

65
00:04:07,243 --> 00:04:11,455
The flooding of greenhouse gases will cause the planet to warm up rapidly.

66
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:13,916
It can cause mass extinction.

67
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:18,671
The size of these cracks would be almost impossible to seal.

68
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:22,925
Even if we could, the pressure would only create new cracks.

69
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,513
Fortunately, we've had at least 50 million years to come up with a solution here.

70
00:04:27,722 --> 00:04:29,890
And we may have discovered something.

71
00:04:30,141 --> 00:04:35,521
In Iceland, recent tests have shown that it is possible to store carbon in basalt.

72
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:39,025
This makes the conversion of these gases into rock very fast.

73
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:41,861
So there's a possibility of a global network of pipelines.

74
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:45,865
They can redirect the gas that's coming out of the rock into basalt deposits.

75
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:50,661
This will reduce emissions and protect our future supercontinent.
