1
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:11,466
Over the years, people have come up with really bad apologies.

2
00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:15,678
From classic non-apologies to evasive excuses,

3
00:00:15,678 --> 00:00:17,638
And the company's fragile promises,

4
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:20,725
It's easy to make bad apologies.

5
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:26,481
But researchers have found that good apologies share a common theme.

6
00:00:26,647 --> 00:00:30,276
And careful consideration of these factors can help you to correct them.

7
00:00:30,276 --> 00:00:33,112
in a variety of situations.

8
00:00:33,946 --> 00:00:37,825
Because public apology has its own complexities,

9
00:00:37,825 --> 00:00:41,329
So we're going to focus on a few personal examples.

10
00:00:42,038 --> 00:00:46,709
Imagine: your new office has a free ice cream sandwich.

11
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:48,294
in the common refrigerator

12
00:00:48,294 --> 00:00:50,505
Or at least that's what you think.

13
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:53,633
But on Friday, when you helped your colleague Terence...

14
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:56,177
Celebrating by another colleague.

15
00:00:56,177 --> 00:01:00,223
He saw half the ice cream he bought for the anniversary was gone.

16
00:01:01,015 --> 00:01:03,726
Although this was clearly an embarrassing accident,

17
00:01:03,726 --> 00:01:07,146
It's still the right thing to stand up and apologize.

18
00:01:07,522 --> 00:01:11,025
Understand and accept responsibility for your actions

19
00:01:11,025 --> 00:01:15,113
is what some researchers call the "center of apology."

20
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,992
But if you feel difficult and vulnerable, that's okay-- it's that

21
00:01:20,243 --> 00:01:24,247
The costly nature of an apology is part of what makes it meaningful.

22
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,668
So while you may be tempted to defend your actions as

23
00:01:28,668 --> 00:01:31,337
It's important to remember that a good apology

24
00:01:31,337 --> 00:01:33,798
It's not about making you feel better.

25
00:01:34,132 --> 00:01:38,302
It's about finding out what the wrong side's perspective is.

26
00:01:38,302 --> 00:01:41,013
and repair the relationship.

27
00:01:41,556 --> 00:01:46,477
This means that while clarifying your intentions without defensiveness can

28
00:01:46,686 --> 00:01:50,731
Your mistake was an accident. It should not have exempted you from the offer.

29
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:52,567
A very sincere apology.

30
00:01:54,068 --> 00:01:57,155
But what if your mistake wasn't an accident?

31
00:01:57,655 --> 00:01:58,823
Consider this:

32
00:01:58,906 --> 00:02:03,327
I promised my friend Marie I'd attend her championship soccer match.

33
00:02:03,327 --> 00:02:06,289
But another friend just called to ask for an extra ticket.

34
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:08,916
For a farewell tour of my favorite musicians.

35
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,544
You know this is a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity,

36
00:02:11,544 --> 00:02:13,588
And you can't ignore it.

37
00:02:14,088 --> 00:02:17,508
Besides, you think Marie wouldn't mind if you missed the game?

38
00:02:17,508 --> 00:02:19,927
She always had a lot of fans.

39
00:02:20,428 --> 00:02:23,639
But the next day, Marie tells him that she is badly injured.

40
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,600
When she can't see you in the crowd.

41
00:02:25,975 --> 00:02:30,897
You feel bad about making her sad and want to apologize.

42
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,357
But while I regret hurting Marie,

43
00:02:33,357 --> 00:02:36,944
You're not really sure that you made the wrong choice.

44
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:41,199
So how do we overcome that non-judgmentalism,

45
00:02:41,365 --> 00:02:43,910
"I'm sorry about this"?

46
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:49,999
In situations like this, it's easy to focus on being rational.

47
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:53,628
When you need to try to understand the other person's perspective.

48
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,423
Ask Marie how you made them feel.

49
00:02:57,423 --> 00:02:59,383
to better understand your criminal behavior.

50
00:02:59,884 --> 00:03:03,262
In this case, Marie can explain that she was disappointed.

51
00:03:03,262 --> 00:03:04,430
You broke your promise.

52
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,225
And she really depends on your support.

53
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:12,063
This clarity can help you recognize your own misbehavior.

54
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:15,566
and honestly accept how your actions have done harm.

55
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:20,071
Then you can say you're sorry about her concerns,

56
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:23,616
Perhaps by admitting that you were wrong to break your promise,

57
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:25,701
And I regret not being with her.

58
00:03:27,536 --> 00:03:30,539
Recognizing Your Wrong Behavior Shows You Know

59
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:32,458
Exactly how you screwed up,

60
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:36,879
And it might give Marie the confidence that you'll behave differently when you move on.

61
00:03:37,255 --> 00:03:41,092
But it's always helpful to show exactly how you're going to change.

62
00:03:41,092 --> 00:03:44,762
And what you will do to repair the damage caused by your criminal acts.

63
00:03:45,012 --> 00:03:47,932
Researchers call this a "repair proposal."

64
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:52,478
And it's often considered one of the most important parts of an apology.

65
00:03:52,937 --> 00:03:56,023
In some cases, these gestures are very direct.

66
00:03:56,023 --> 00:03:58,818
Like, you can offer to replace the ice cream that you eat.

67
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,029
However, with less obvious violations,

68
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:04,115
This may need to be more symbolic,

69
00:04:04,407 --> 00:04:08,035
For example, you could say, Ã¢I'm sorry I couldn't help you with your homework.

70
00:04:08,369 --> 00:04:11,998
A common repair proposal is verbal commitment

71
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:14,208
No more of that mistake.

72
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:19,588
But promises of doing better only work if you actually do better.

73
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,176
Taking the victim's perspective, accepting responsibility,

74
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:26,721
and make specific recommendations for repairs

75
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:29,473
just a few of the elements of a good apology.

76
00:04:29,724 --> 00:04:34,395
But remember, apologizing is not about being forgiven and moving on;

77
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:38,524
It's about expressing regret and accepting responsibility.

78
00:04:38,983 --> 00:04:42,236
And the best apology is just the first step.

79
00:04:42,236 --> 00:04:44,322
on the path to reconciliation.
